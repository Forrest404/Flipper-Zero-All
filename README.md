## Introduction

The Flipper Zero is a versatile hacking and security tool designed for exploring and interacting with various electronic devices. This repository contains a collection of files and tools that can be used in conjunction with the Flipper Zero device to perform various hardware hacking tasks. It's important to use these tools responsibly and legally.

## Included Tools and Definitions

### NFID (Near-Field Identification)

NFID refers to the process of identifying and interacting with nearby electronic devices using radio frequency communication. This can include devices like RFID cards, access control systems, and more.

### NFC (Near-Field Communication)

NFC is a subset of NFID that allows for two-way communication between devices over short distances. It is commonly used for contactless payments, access control, and data transfer between smartphones and other devices.

### Sub-GHz

Sub-GHz frequencies refer to radio frequencies that are below 1 GHz. These frequencies are commonly used for wireless communication in devices like remote controls, IoT devices, and industrial applications.

### IR/IR Fuzzer (Infrared/Infrared Fuzzer)

Infrared (IR) communication involves the use of infrared light to transmit data between devices. An IR fuzzer can be used to test and interact with IR-based systems such as remote controls and IR receivers.

### Brute Force Attack

A brute force attack is a method of trying all possible combinations or passwords systematically in order to gain unauthorized access to a system or device.

### iButton/iButton Fuzzer

iButton is a brand of electronic tokens that can be used for various applications, including access control. An iButton fuzzer is a tool for testing and interacting with iButton-based systems.

### Bad USB

Bad USB refers to a type of attack where a compromised USB device, such as a USB keyboard or flash drive, is used to exploit vulnerabilities in a target system.
